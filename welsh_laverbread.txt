Prep:15min  ›  Cook:6hr  ›  Ready in:6hr15min 
Wash the seaweed and rinse in clean water several times. Over a low heat, or in a slow cooker, simmer the seaweed for 6 hours until it turns into a dark pulp.
Combine the laverbread, olive oil, lemon juice and seasoning and stir through. Toast the bread then butter to taste. Spoon the laverbread onto the hot toast and serve immediately.
Tip
You can buy tinned laverbread if you are short on time; it works just as well in this recipe but may not be as flavourful.
